# Term-Deposit-Prediction-project

Term-Deposit-Prediction-project is a name that can refer to different data analysis projects that aim to predict whether a bank customer will subscribe to a term deposit or not. A term deposit is a type of savings account where the money is locked for a fixed period of time and earns interest. Some examples of Term-Deposit-Prediction-project are:

A project that uses Python libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and numpy to analyze and visualize bank customer data.
A project that explores the impact of variables such as education, marital status, and job on the willingness to subscribe to a term deposit.
A project that builds a machine learning model to indicate the key variables that influence conversion and the probability of subscribing to a term deposit

python packages :

1) pandas for data manipulation
2) numpy for mathmatical calculations
3) matplotlib.pyplot for data visualization and graphical plotting
4) seaborn for data visualization and exploratory data analysis
5) pandas_profiling for data summarization
6) from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder # For converting categorical data into numerical
7) from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler # For scaling the data
8) from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split # For dividing data into train and test
9) from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier  # RandomForest Classification
10) from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier      # Decision Tree Classification
11) from sklearn.metrics import f1_score    #F1 Score
12) from sklearn.metrics import precision_score #Precision Score
13) from sklearn.metrics import classification_report  #For Classification Report
14) from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
